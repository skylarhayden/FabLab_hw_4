Parametric Form

Assignment: Create a module which accepts three parameters, capable of producting at least three different, but related, forums.

I decided for this assignment to take one of my old prints and add in parameters. I did this with my print from HW 2 and made the height, width and number of sides of the base shape, parameters. In the photos it can be seen that one shows changing the height, another the width and another the number of sides of the shape. There is also a picture of its origianl form.
